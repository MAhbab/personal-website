Why am I here? On this site, I mean. Why aren't I instead going for a walk or making scrambled eggs or finally starting *The Last of Us* on HBO? Furthermore, why write here instead of on a traditional writing platform like [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [Substack](https://substack.com/)? Lastly, why am I doing this now, just a few years out of school, still learning how the "real world" works, a dilettante without any notable expertise? Wouldn't it be better to save writing til *after* I've put a dozen years into becoming an expert at something?

I'm here in part for pragmatic reasons. Writing is among the most [important](https://essay.app/guide#why-bother) skills one can foster. I don't believe it's possible to be a good thinker without being a good writer. The value of being a sound thinker should require no justification. Information is more abundant than ever, which makes the ability to think all the more salient. I want to become a better thinker by sharing with you, the reader, the best ideas I encounter.

Okay, fair enough. Writing helps us think better. Why not do what thousands of others have done, forging their writing habits post by post on the likes of Medium, Substack, Quora, and LinkedIn? Well, I haven't entirely written off those options; at some point in the future I might move to a traditional writing platform. My reasons for starting here are two fold. First, I'm more interested in refining my words in a low stakes environment than I am in building a massive following to sell to our overlords Bezos and Pichai. Second, and more importantly, I'm fascinated by how traditional online writing can be enhanced with interactive elements. I mean, wouldn't it be cool if, while you were reading about the latest unemployment numbers from the BLS, there were an embedded graph that let you see how unemployment rates differed by state? Maybe that's a silly idea, maybe not. Either way, having direct and complete control of my posts at the HTML level lets me experiment with different ways of explaining an idea.

So far, we've established that writing is beneficial, and that writing here provides a low stakes environment to experiment in. Why now, though? I work a lot, I have friends (allegedly). Why carve out time for this new habit despite the opportunity cost? I don't really have a good answer here. All I can say is that I have a gut instinct that leads me to try new things, and it's never let me down before.

Phew! With all the out of the way, hopefully you have a better idea of why I'm here and what you can expect to find here. Thanks for your time!
