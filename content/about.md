Welcome!

My name is Mahfuj, and this is my space to explore a range of topics spanning data science, financial markets, history, video games, and more. My core professional experience is in data science and analysis, though I've worked a variety of odd jobs including as a bouncer, math tutor, and camp counselor. 

This is my place to share ideas that interest me as well as small projects I work on from time to time. 

If you'd like to talk, feel free to email me directly or send a message on LinkedIn.
