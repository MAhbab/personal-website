Welcome!

My name is Mahfuj, and this is a space to explore ideas spanning financial markets, literature, video games, and whatever else piques my interest. My core professional experience is in data science and analytics, though I've worked a variety of odd jobs in my youth i.e. undergrad including as a bouncer, math tutor, and camp counselor. 

You can expect to find short articles here along with prototypical web apps usually centered around data visualization.

I hope you find something of interest here! If you'd like to contact me please reach out via email or LinkedIn; links to both can be found below/on the home page.
